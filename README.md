print("\65")
print("\x65")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b")

print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
print("python\n\t2023")
print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
print("\65")
print("\x65")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")

7. Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum?
num=23, textnum="57", decimal=98.3

8. calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time. Print a statement that describes what your code does also. Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in an hour, hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values. (hint) total number of minutes in a year =No.of days in a year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour

Daysofyear = 365
Hoursinday = 24
Mininhour = 60

print("Multiplying above three variables\nwill give total minutes in a year which is",Daysofyear*Hoursinday*Mininhour,"minutes")
